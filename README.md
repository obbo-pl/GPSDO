# GPSDO
GPS Disciplined Oscillator

##### Main features:

- 2 outputs 40MHz square wave, signal level 3.3V,
- 1pps, signal level 3.3V,
- for 40MHz output, error less than 0.15ppm,
- frequency verification every 2 seconds,
- stabilization of the frequency after about 80 seconds from the appearance of the 1pps signal,
- accomplishment of stabilization signaled by the logic level at the "FIX" output,
- automatic building of temperature characteristics,
- stabilization based on the temperature characteristic with an error of less than 0.3ppm, 
- supply voltage 5V,
- current consumption about 130mA,
- transparent transmission of messages from and to the U-BLOX module,
- parameter control via serial port (19200bps),
